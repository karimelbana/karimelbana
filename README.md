### Hi there I am Karim 👋

### How I like my code
I'm passionate about code quality. Details matter. This is why I prefer writing code that is

- Minimal (no semicolons)
- Clean (no spaghetti code)
- KISS (Keep it stupid simple) and DRY (Do not repeat yourself)
- Atomic & Reusable
- Well tested
- I'm a big advocate of Design being not "just drawings" but the way we organize information. Good design is key to success and hence a good code base should closely follow good design.
- Demonstrated in Storybook
- I believe that these contribute to stronger and faster development and a strong dev culture.

### Some of my favourite projects are:

- [SolarOdyssey](https://karimelbana-solarodyssey-interfacesolar-app-gq3677.streamlit.app/), the deep learning model that predicts energy demand of rural villages in Nigeria using sattelite images
